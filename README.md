## 🦀 **Rust Workshop: Multi-Agent Systems (Biological and Physical Simulations)**

**How can simple rules give rise to complex collective behaviors?**

This workshop provides an introduction to multi-agent systems (Agent-Based Models).
The goal is to understand and model the emergence of natural, physical, or biological phenomena using this paradigm.

### 🚀 Workshop Schedule (2 hours)

- **Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems (30 min):**
    - Presentation of fundamental differences between classical programming and agent-oriented programming.
    - Analysis of famous cases where local interactions lead to emergent global intelligence.
- **Coding and Practice (1 h 30 min):**
    - Implementation of simulation algorithms within a high-performance architecture.

### 🛠 Simulation Projects

You will have the choice to implement one or more of these simulations:

- **Conway's Game of Life:** the foundational cellular automaton.
- **Boids (flocking):** simulation of fish schools or bird flocks.
- **Slime mold (Physarum polycephalum):** modeling of slime molds and biological transport networks.
- **Fluid dynamics:** physical simulation of particles.

### 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Curiosity for algorithms.
- ✅ Basic knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming.
- ✅ Basic knowledge of Rust.
- ✅ Rust (cargo) installed on your machine.
